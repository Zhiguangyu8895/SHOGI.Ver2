# SHOGI.Ver2
After finishing SHOGI Ver 1.0 (you can access from https://zhiguangyu8895.github.io/SHOGI/) 
I decide to divide it into a MVC app,
make the code more readable,
use more html5 and css,
add some new functions like
  change skins (for my cute animal shogi),
  input shogi records.
So I start this SHOGI.Ver2 project.
